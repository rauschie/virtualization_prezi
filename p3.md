# Hardware Virtualization
_the virtualization of computers as complete hardware platforms, certain logical
abstractions of their componentry, or only the functionality required to run
various operating systems._ 
## Why
- server consolidation:
    many small physical servers are replaced by one larger physical server to decrease the need for more (costly) hardware resources such as CPUs, and hard drives.

- A virtual machine (VM) can be more easily controlled and inspected from a remote site than a physical machine

- A new virtual machine can be provisioned as required without the need for an up-front hardware purchase.

- A virtual machine can easily be relocated from one physical machine to another as needed.
