<h1>OS-level virtualization</h1>
<p><em>OS-level virtualization refers to an operating system paradigm in which the
kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances, called
containers.</em></p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<ul>
<li>commonly used in virtual hosting environments, where it is useful for securely allocating finite hardware resources among a large number of mutually-distrusting users.</li>
<li>separating several programs to separate containers for improved security, hardware independence, and added resource management features.</li>
</ul>
