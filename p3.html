<h1>Hardware Virtualization</h1>
<p><em>the virtualization of computers as complete hardware platforms, certain logical
abstractions of their componentry, or only the functionality required to run
various operating systems.</em></p>
<h2>Why</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>server consolidation:
many small physical servers are replaced by one larger physical server to decrease the need for more (costly) hardware resources such as CPUs, and hard drives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A virtual machine (VM) can be more easily controlled and inspected from a remote site than a physical machine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new virtual machine can be provisioned as required without the need for an up-front hardware purchase.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A virtual machine can easily be relocated from one physical machine to another as needed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
