# What

- ## Hardware virtualization
    or platform virtualization refers to the creation of a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with an operating system. Software executed on these virtual machines is separated from the underlying hardware resources. For example, a computer that is running Microsoft Windows may host a virtual machine that looks like a computer with the Ubuntu Linux operating system; Ubuntu-based software can be run on the virtual machine.
- ## Desktop virtualization
    is a software technology that separates the desktop environment and associated application software from the physical client device that is used to access it. 
 - ## Containerization
    or Operating-system-level virtualization, refers to an operating system feature in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user-space instances.
