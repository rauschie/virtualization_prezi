# OS-level virtualization
 _OS-level virtualization refers to an operating system paradigm in which the
 kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances, called
 containers._

## Why
- commonly used in virtual hosting environments, where it is useful for securely allocating finite hardware resources among a large number of mutually-distrusting users.
- separating several programs to separate containers for improved security, hardware independence, and added resource management features.
