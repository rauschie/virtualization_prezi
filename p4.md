# Desktop Virtualization
_a software technology that separates the desktop environment and associated
application software from the physical client device that is used to access it._

 ## Why

- in distributed environments with high availability requirements and where desk-side technical support is not readily available, such as branch office and retail environments.
- in environments where high network latency degrades the performance of conventional client/server applications
- in environments where remote access and data security requirements create
  conflicting requirements that can be addressed by retaining all (application)
  data within the data center – with only display, keyboard, and mouse
  information communicated with the remote client.

  ## How
  - Remote desktop virtualization implementations operate in a client/server computing environment. Application execution takes place on a remote operating system which communicates with the local client device over a network using a remote display protocol through which the user interacts with applications.
  - Remote desktop virtualization can also be provided via cloud computing
    similar to that provided using a software as a service model.
  - User virtualization separates all of the software aspects that define a
    user’s personality on a device from the operating system and applications to
    be managed independently and applied to a desktop as needed without the need
    for scripting, group policies, or use of roaming profiles.
  - Desktop layering is a method of desktop virtualization that divides a disk image into logical parts to be managed individually. For example, if all members of a user group use the same OS, then the core OS only needs to be backed up once for the entire environment who share this layer.
  - Local desktop virtualization implementations run the desktop environment on
    the client device using hardware virtualization or emulation.
